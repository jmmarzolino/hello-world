# hello-world
Hello hello!

I'm very new to coding, but enjoying the sudden immersion. Gettting my feet wet with a little graphing and such for my classes and reserach. I plan to catch 'em all! (all the...uh bug types? haha)
Now I hope nobody ever ever sees this :)

I like fancy teas and cookies. Like the concept of rain but can't stand a gray sky for long. Gay gamer girl and avid literary fantic. All around nerd, into crafting and just starting cross stitch. I've been working on an afghan square blanket forever and will probably continue forever more. 
I love all kinds of spicy foods but am generally a really bad cook (I'm never interested enough to look up recipes, get ingredients, and follow through). 
Double major in Plant Biology and English. Currently applying to grad schools (someone please love and accept me <3 so that I may science my life away). I am really friendly and silly, like to make jokes just for myself even if it gets me into trouble when no one else follows that train of thought; makes for a fun life though. I do too many favors and struggle to say no, but everything is working out well so far. 
Curretly behind in books to read, work to do, games to play, projects to finish, instruments and languages to learn, books to write, and healthy life choices. Day by day I make progress!
